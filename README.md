# Showcase Portfolio Deniz Hadjiosmanov

This is the Git repository where I keep track of the development of my Portfolio Website. I have separeted the repository in 2 folders: 

-- One folder where I am making <b>Proofs of Concepts</b>.<br>
-- A folder where I will be <b>developing the actual portfolio website</b>.
