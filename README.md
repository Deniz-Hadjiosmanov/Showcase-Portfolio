# Showcase Portfolio Deniz Hadjiosmanov

This is the Git repository where I keep track of the development of my Portfolio Website.

## Structure of my Portfolio Website

My website has a one-pager structure and it consists of 4 sections. You can go to any section from any section

- Home section - the first thing the user sees when they open the website.
- Projects section - it includes my selected projects that I am showcasing.
- About section - it includes my expertise and reasons for employers to hire me as their next intern.
- Contact - here the users can copy my contact details such as LinkedIn, Email etc.

## Building my Portfolio Website

In order to implement my website, I used Vite in combination with React. The reason why I chose React is because it offers a component-based structure in the coding process thus making the latter easier, more efficient and optimized in general.

## Purpose of my Portfolio Website

I will use my portfolio from now on while searching for my graduation internship next semester. In this way, I will be able to present myself and my expertise in a professional way. Moreover, I plan to use this portfolio even after graduating so that I have a straightforward way to represent myself as a young professional.
